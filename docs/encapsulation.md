# Encapsulation

## What are the benefits of the Encapsulated Language numerals?

### Base-12

The numerals have been designed with a Base-12 system in mind. Latin numerals
don't function cleanly with a Base-12 system.

### 3x Multiplication

The 3, 6, 9 numerals are all made from three strokes. This shows that they all
belong to the 3x Multiplication table.

### 4x Multiplication

The numerals 4 and 8 are the only numerals that exclusively consist of vertical
bars. This shows that they belong to the 4x Multiplication table.

### Arithmetic

The following numerals are made from other numerals.

- 5 is made from 4 + 1
- 6 is made from 4 + 2
- 7 is made from 4 + 3
- 9 is made from 8 + 1
- 10 is made from 8 + 2
- 11 is made from 8 + 3

### Intuitive

Every numeral follows a specific design pattern. 1, 2 and 3 also visually
represent their quantities.

### Distinct

Every numeral is visually distinct from every other numeral. This ensures
there's no ambiguity when writing in sequence.

### Extensibility

The numeral system can be extended using the same design pattern without
introducing inconsistencies in design. It has been proven that this numeral
system can work effectively for base-2, base-8 and even base-16.

### Similarity to traditional Chinese numerals

The 1, 2 and 3 numerals are similar to traditional Chinese numerals making them
slightly easier to learn for East Asian learners.
