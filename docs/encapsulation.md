# Encapsulation

Each area of the language encapsulates as much scientific and mathematical knowledge as possible.

## Numerals

![Numerals](/elp-documentation/img/Numerals.png)

The numerals encapsulate the following mathematical knowledge:

### Base-12

The numerals have been designed with a Base-12 system in mind. Latin numerals
don't function cleanly with a Base-12 system.

### 3x Multiplication

The 3, 6, 9 numerals are all made from three strokes. This shows that they all
belong to the 3x Multiplication table.

### 4x Multiplication

The numerals 4 and 8 are the only numerals that exclusively consist of vertical
bars. This shows that they belong to the 4x Multiplication table.

### Arithmetic

The following numerals are made from other numerals.

- 5 is made from 4 + 1
- 6 is made from 4 + 2
- 7 is made from 4 + 3
- 9 is made from 8 + 1
- 10 is made from 8 + 2
- 11 is made from 8 + 3

### Intuitive

Every numeral follows a specific design pattern. 1, 2 and 3 also visually
represent their quantities.

### Distinct

Every numeral is visually distinct from every other numeral. This ensures
there's no ambiguity when writing in sequence.

### Extensibility

The numeral system can be extended using the same design pattern without
introducing inconsistencies in design. It has been proven that this numeral
system can work effectively for base-2, base-8 and even base-16.

### Similarity to traditional Chinese numerals

The 1, 2 and 3 numerals are similar to traditional Chinese numerals making them
slightly easier to learn for East Asian learners.

## Phonological Values

The phonological values encapsulate the following mathematical knowledge:

## Numeric Prefixes

| Numbers        | Numeric Prefix   |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 0              | ei̯-              |
| 1              | wa-              |
| 2              | jo-              |
| 3              | eu̯-              |
| 4              | ai̯-              |
| 5              | wo-              |
| 6              | je-              |
| 7              | au̯-              |
| 8              | oi̯-              |
| 9              | we-              |
| X (10)         | ja-              |
| E (11)         | ou̯-              |

The numeric prefixes encapsulate the following mathematical knowledge:

### Evenness
Numeric prefixes that contain /j/ represent **even numbers**.
Numeric prefixes that contain /w/ represent **odd numbers**.

### 3x Multiplication
Numeric prefixes that contain /e/ are part of the 3x multiplication table. This matches with the Official Numerals which also shows the 3x multiplication table through the number of strokes.

### 4x Multiplication
Numeric prefixes that end with /i̯/ are part of the 4x multiplication table.

### Arithmetic
Swapping the position of the vowel within a numeric prefix either adds or removes 6 from the total value. For example:
Swapping the position of the vowel in /ei̯/ (0) will create /je/ (6).
Swapping the position of the vowel in /ja/ (10) will create /ai̯/ (4).
