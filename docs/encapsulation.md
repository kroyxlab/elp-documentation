# Encapsulation

Each area of the language encapsulates as much scientific and mathematical
knowledge as possible.

## Numerals

![Numerals](/elp-documentation/img/numbers/Numerals.png)

The numerals encapsulate the following mathematical knowledge:

### Base-12

The numerals have been designed with a Base-12 system in mind. Latin numerals
don't function cleanly with a Base-12 system.

### 3x Multiplication

The 3, 6, 9 numerals are all made from three strokes. This shows that they all
belong to the 3x Multiplication table.

### 4x Multiplication

The numerals 4 and 8 are the only numerals that exclusively consist of vertical
bars. This shows that they belong to the 4x Multiplication table.

### Arithmetic

The following numerals are made from other numerals.

- 5 is made from 4 + 1
- 6 is made from 4 + 2
- 7 is made from 4 + 3
- 9 is made from 8 + 1
- 10 is made from 8 + 2
- 11 is made from 8 + 3

### Intuitive

Every numeral follows a specific design pattern. 1, 2 and 3 also visually
represent their quantities.

### Distinct

Every numeral is visually distinct from every other numeral. This ensures
there's no ambiguity when writing in sequence.

### Extensibility

The numeral system can be extended using the same design pattern without
introducing inconsistencies in design. It has been proven that this numeral
system can work effectively for base-2, base-8 and even base-16.

### Similarity to traditional Chinese numerals

The 1, 2 and 3 numerals are similar to traditional Chinese numerals making them
slightly easier to learn for East Asian learners.

## Phonological Values

The phonological values encapsulate the following mathematical knowledge:

## Numeric Prefixes

| Numbers | Numeric Prefix |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 0       | ei-            |
| 1       | wa-            |
| 2       | jo-            |
| 3       | eu-            |
| 4       | ai-            |
| 5       | wo-            |
| 6       | je-            |
| 7       | au-            |
| 8       | oi-            |
| 9       | we-            |
| X (10)  | ja-            |
| E (11)  | ou-            |

The numeric prefixes encapsulate the following mathematical knowledge:

### Evenness

Numeric prefixes that contain "j" represent **even numbers**.
Numeric prefixes that contain "w" represent **odd numbers**.

### 3x Multiplication

Numeric prefixes that contain "e" are part of the 3x multiplication table. This
matches with the Official Numerals which also shows the 3x multiplication table
through the number of strokes.

### 4x Multiplication

Numeric prefixes that end with "i" are part of the 4x multiplication table.

### Arithmetic

Swapping the position of the vowel within a numeric prefix either adds or
removes 6 from the total value. For example:

Swapping the position of the vowel in "ei" (0) will create "je" (6).
Swapping the position of the vowel in "ja" (10) will create "ai" (4).
