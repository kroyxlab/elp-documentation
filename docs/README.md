## Language Name

**We’re currently accepting proposals.**

The language doesn’t currently have a name.

## Language Logo / Flag

**We’re currently accepting proposals.**

The language doesn’t currently have a logo.

## Aim of the Language

**We’re currently accepting improvements of the wording to the stated aim of the language. If you wish to change the wording, please present your proposal in Reddit first.**

The Encapsulated Language Project aims to create a Language that encapsulates as much scientific and mathematical knowledge within the sounds and constructs of the Language itself to facilitate an intuitive understanding of the world around us. A speaker of this language will have instant access to a large pool of knowledge simply through understanding how to unpack their own language and utilise the knowledge cached within it.

## Encapsulated Language Project Definitions

**Draft Proposal:** A Proposal to change an Official Proposal or add to the language. An addition to the language must be in accordance with all current Official Proposals. Essentially, this is an idea for a change or an addition seeking community feedback.

**Official Proposal:** A Proposal that defines an aspect of the language and has community support (it has been voted on and approved by 50% of voting participants). All Draft Proposals must work in accordance with all existing Official Proposals.

**Language Fundamental:** An aspect of the language that can’t be changed by any single individual or groups of individuals.

## History of the Encapsulated Language Project

The project was founded by Evildea on 18th June 2020. The original proposal for the language can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VCLTq6epQQ)

Shortly afterwards, Evildea started the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/)
