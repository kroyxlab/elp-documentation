## Why Base-6?

Base-6 was promoted to an Official Proposal on the 13th of September 2020 (Base-12 vs Base-6). 
Some of the reasons why Base-6 was preferred by the community at large are listed below.
For a comprehensive list of reasons for and against Base-6, you'll need to dig
through the subreddit history.

- Base-6 can be cleanly divided by 1, 2, 3 and 6 making it more fraction-friendly than Base-10.
- 6 is the biggest number with only two coprimes, 1 and 5. This means the multiplication table 
is regular and has a relatively high frequency of numbers which end with a 0.
- Base-6 requires less rote memorization than Base-10.
- Base-6 was considered a happy medium between the number of digits required
  and the resulting number of numerals.
- π in Base-6 has two zeros in a row early on. This means that memorizing six digits is as precise 
as memorizing eight.

Additionally, mathematical constants such as π can be represented in base-6
(or any base for that matter) as they simply represent ratios.

- π (base-10): 3.141592653...
- π (base-6): 3.050330051...

Finally, all computers operate on base-2 and constantly perform countless
conversions between base-10 and base-2 every clock cycle. This means there would
be no additional burden placed upon technology.

## What is the history of the phonology?

The first proto-phonology was promoted to an Official Proposal on the 15th of
July 2020. This was preceded by weeks of intense debates and official votes.
This proposal eventually won community support because it was highly
minimalistic and contained a pattern of 12 plosives and fricatives.

The phonology then underwent rapid development as the community improved upon it.

On the 18th of July 2020, the phonemes /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ were replaced with /f/ and
/v/ to improve the plosive and fricative pattern. The phoneme /j/ was also
introduced to extend the phonology further and due to its prevalence in world
languages.

On the 22nd of July 2020, the /r/ was replaced with /ɾ/ because the trill was
considered notoriously difficult and provided no advantage over the alveolar tap.

On the 2nd of August 2020, the proto-number word system introduced the
following consonants /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /t͡s/, /d͡z/, /t͡ʃ/, /d͡ʒ/, /w/, the following
vowels /y/ and /yː/, along with the following diphthongs /ai̯/, /ei̯/, /oi̯/,
/au̯/, /eu̯/ and /ou̯/. This large change to the phonology was required to build
the underlying patterns of the new number word system.

On the 9th of September 2020, the consonant /ʔ/ was introduced by a phonotactics 
proposal to be the very first consonant in a syllable.

The phonology is still considered highly unstable and further changes are
expected.
