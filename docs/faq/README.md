# FAQ

## What kind of language is the Encapsulated Language Project creating?

The Encapsulated Language Project is creating a language that will store as much
scientific and mathematical knowledge as possible. Naturally, this will result
in an a priori language whose phonology, grammar and vocabulary will be
consciously devised.

## Is internationalization more important than encapsulation?

The aims and goals of the language state:

"The Encapsulated Language Project aims to create a Language that encapsulates
as much scientific and mathematical knowledge within the sounds, syllables,
words, patterns, and essence of the Language itself to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of the world around us."

The aims and goals of the language don't mention internationalization.

On the 18th of July 2020, the
[community voted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hle5yj/what_do_we_want_to_encapsulate_in_our_phonologies/)
that "phonologies shouldn't focus on being international but on information
packing so that we can have more flexibility down the track when developing the
language."

On the 24th of July 2020, [u/Flamerate1](https://www.reddit.com/u/Flamerate1)
(Official Proposal Committee Member) reinforced the importance of encapsulation
by stating, "The goal of this language is encapsulation. We want to figure out
systems that will allow us to pack and easily retrieve information from the
common words that one would use in daily life, as their current phonemic
representations in most languages are usually meaningless."

In summary, proposals should prioritize encapsulation over internationalization.

## How is the Encapsulated Language different from Lojban or Ithkuil?

Lojban aims to be logical, grammatically unambiguous, and test the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.

Ithkuil aims to minimize the ambiguities and semantic vagueness found in natural human languages. In essence, it aims to be as semantically dense as possible.

The Encapsulated language aims to encapsulate as much scientific and mathematical knowledge as possible to facilitate an intuitive understanding of the world around us.

## What knowledge will be encapsulated?

::: tip We’re currently accepting proposals.
present your proposal in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/new/)
:::

The primary disciplines whose fundamentals will be encapsulated within the
language are:

**Formal Sciences**

- Math

**Natural Sciences**

- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Geology

**Composite Sciences**

- Technology (Engineering)
- Medicine
- Agronomy
- Geography

**Social Sciences**

- Psychology
- Sociology

A large array of knowledge from other disciplines will also be encapsulated. The
primary decider on what knowledge is encapsulated and isn't will be pertinence
of usage for school-age children. The aim is to store the fundamental concepts
of each of these disciplines, not the entire discipline itself.

## How is mathematical and scientific information encapsulated?

An example of encapsulation can be found in the
[Official Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hvmhsr/official_proposal_vote_to_officialise_the_numeral/)
for the numerals. The numerals have the following information cached within them:

- 3x multiplication table (Any numeral that consists of three strokes belongs to
  the 3x multiplication table)

- 4x multiplication table (Any numeral that contains only horizontal bars
  belongs to the 4x multiplication table)

- All numerals representing a number greater than 4 are built from the numerals
  1, 2, 3, or 4.

A child who speaks this language natively would be taught how to recognise all
the patterns that exist within their language. In the case of the numerals, they
would be taught how to recognise the 3x and 4x multiplication tables visually.
They'd also intuitively learn that numbers like 6 are actually additions
consisting of 4 + 2.

## How do we intend on protecting the language against language degradation?

It's vitally important to the success of the Language that the mathematical and
scientific knowledge encapsulated within it doesn't become lost with time. This
doesn't mean that we must fight against all language evolution, it just means
that we must carefully manage its evolution to avoid knowledge degradation.

So is it even possible to manage the evolution of a language?

Yes, Esperanto is a perfect example of a language whose internal culture
protects it against language degradation and haphazard evolution. The internal
culture of Esperanto prizes evolution which improves upon the language, but
doesn't divert from the rules laid out over a hundred years ago in the
"Fundamento de Esperanto". In essence, it's the first language with a
constitution that's actively upheld by the majority of the community.

Icelandic is another perfect example of a language whose prescriptivist culture
protects it against unacceptable language evolution. In the early half of the
20th century, Icelandic started to undergo a rapid
[/ɪ/-/ɛ/ merger](https://is.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flámæli). People in the West and
South of Iceland started dropping their short i's and y's in favor of e's and
œ's instead. Within a generation, this "speech error" rapidly spread across the
island, and by 1929, 42% of children in Reykjavík spoke improper Icelandic. In
the late 1940s, the Icelandic government implemented a campaign to
systematically eradicate this speech error through early primary school
education. The National Theater also enforced a policy of proper speech at all
times. By the 1960s, this widespread speech error had been eliminated.

We intend on implementing our own constitution and foster a prescriptivist
culture that actively protects our language from language degradation in order
to protect the knowledge cached within it.

## What is the process to change the language or expand on the language?

In order to make changes to the language, the following process needs to be
adhered to.

1. The **Proponent** of the change or addition needs to clearly define what
   aspect of the language they think needs to be changed or added to.

2. The **Proponent** then needs to check the “Encapsulated Language Project
   Documentation” to see whether any existing Draft Proposal covers their proposed
   changes or additions.

   - If there’s an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should throw
     their support behind that proposal.

   - If there isn’t an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should
     post their [Draft Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/)
     for feedback.

3. The **Proponent** should acknowledge community feedback and update their
   Draft Proposal accordingly.

4. If a **Draft Proposal** generates enough community feedback / support, the
   Proponent can send their finalized Proposal to the
   **Official Proposal Committee**. The Official Proposal Committee will review
   the Proposal and either accept or reject the Proposal based on their mandate.
   If the Proposal is accepted /u/ActingAustralia (Richard Delamore) will organise
   a community vote asking the community to either accept or reject the proposal.
   Members of the community will have 2 or 3 days to vote in the poll (depending
   on the severity of the change). If the Official Proposal gets 50% or more
   support, the Proposal will be promoted to an Official Proposal.

## What is the Official Proposal Committee?

The Official Proposal Committee is responsible for ensuring that all Draft
Proposals seeking officialisation through community vote adhere to the aims and
goals of the Language.

**Submission of Proposals**

The Proponent must send their finalized Draft Proposal to any member of the
Official Proposal Committee with a request for Officialisation.

**Review of Proposals**

- The Official Proposal Committee must ensure that all Draft Proposals seeking
  officialisation through community vote adhere to the aims and goals of the Language.

- The Official Proposal Committee must provide a proponent of a rejected Draft
  Proposal with a reason for why the Proposal was rejected.

- If a vote to accept/reject a Proposal results in a tie, /u/ActingAustralia
  (Richard Delamore) will act as the tie breaker.

**Membership**

- The Official Proposal Committee consists of exactly six members.

- If a member retires from the committee or becomes inactive, the other members
  of the committee can vote to remove him/her. A vote for removal requires
  majority support among committee members.

- The committee can choose to fill a vacant position by any means it desires,
  however, the new committee member must have a strong record of consistent and
  active participation in the project to be eligible.

## How to write a good draft proposal

To make sure your proposal is as well understood as possible and to get both the
maximum support and maximum effect, here are some best practices on how to
draft a good proposal. But bear in mind: none of this is a formal requirement.
A project like this has so many aspects and dimensions; your proposal might
have a new approach that requires it’s own style of proposal or it might
concern an area of the project that no one has yet consciously thought of. So:
Write what you think is right.

But still, read through the following paragraphs. Either the tips and
guidelines presented here can be used directly for your proposal, or they at
least outline a “spirit”, a way of thinking that are worth considering.

### Research

Before posting, try to familiarize yourself with the discussion in the
community regarding your topic. Has it already been discussed? Is it still
being discussed? Are there active related proposals out there, at the moment?

That way you’ll not only be able to formulate a more thoroughly thought through
proposal, but you also might find people who are interested in the same or
similar topics to exchange ideas and collaborate with.

### Is it already a proposal? Or still just an idea?

Even if a draft proposal is essentially a call for feedback, it’s still a
proposal. That means, you have something concrete to propose that people can
agree or disagree with.

Otherwise it’s probably an idea or a call for feedback or collaboration, the
start of a discussion etc. In that latter case, no special structure is
required.

[Click here for a good example](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hxofaz/ideas_on_continental_division/)
for a well written idea that is not a proposal.

If it is a proposal, continue on…

### Is it one proposal? Or several?

If there are several issues to your proposal that people might want to
(dis)agree with seperately, split it up into separate proposals. If they relate
to one another, don’t hesitate to describe those relations. But only pack them
into one proposal if they don’t make any sense on their own and only function
together.

### Write your proposal

The following aspects are key features of a good proposal:

1. Summary: Briefly summarize your proposal. What is it concerned with?
2. Intention of Proposal: What problem are you trying to solve?
3. Context: If there are other proposals or discussions out there that might
	 help a reader to better understand your proposal to its full extent, provide
	 links and maybe a bit of info.
4. Proposed change: Describe as exactly as possible the changes or new features you propose.
5. Effect: How will the Proposal help achieve the goals of the language?

- Especially if it's a proposal that implements some encapsulation, describe which information is encapsulated and how.
- Does your change affects the accessibility of the language?

6. Scope: Which new elements will be introduced into the language (if any)?
	 Which existing parts of the language will need to change or be rescinded?
7. Examples: Practical examples of the change

Good examples for proposals who show several or all of these features:
[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hyfrop/the_encapsulated_verbal_number_system/),
[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hxk1xn/phonotactics_proposal/)

Bonus: Open questions, possible extensions. If applicable, give an idea on how
your proposal could be extended and used to further develop the language.

[Click here for a good example](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hs30jj/advanced_form_of_numeral_system_part_v_arithmetic/) for this bonus aspect of extendability.

### Post it to the subreddit

When your proposal is finally done, post it to the
[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/) and don’t forget to
add the flair that represents the kind of proposal you're making. If none of the flairs 
match then use the “Draft Proposal”-flair. That way, people will know that it actually is 
a proposal and also the Members of the [Official Proposals Committee](https://kroyxlab.github.io/elp-documentation/faq/#what-is-the-official-proposal-committee)
will know what needs to be looked at and updated on the website.

### Template

The following is a template you can use to format your proposal:

**Summary:**
Provide a summary of your proposal.
**Current State:**
State which, if any Official Proposal or part thereof, your Draft Proposal will directly affect.
**Proposed State:**
State your proposal in clear and concise language. Write it as if it were a description of a rule that 
already exists. Don't use words like "maybe", "perhaps" etc...
**Reason:**
State the reason this proposal is necessary and how it fits with the Aims and Goals of the Language.

## When will the Language be finalised

A language can never be truly finalised, however, we do need an end date to work
towards. Therefore, in exactly 5 years from 18th June 2020 (the founding date)
all **Official Proposals** will become **Language Fundamentals** and all
remaining **Draft Proposals** will be automatically rejected. The entire
language will be published free online as a single book. For all intents and
purposes, the language will be finalised and no single person or group will have
the right to fundamentally change the language. Further developments in the
language, however, can and will occur through natural language evolution.

## Why do we need to finalise the Language?

History has shown us time and again that language projects fail when they become
unstable due to constant reforms and improvements. Therefore, a finalisation
date for the core of the language is necessary to ensure its future survival and
mass adoption.

Unfortunately this means the language will never be “perfect”, but it does mean
that we’ll feel safe knowing that it won’t suddenly and fundamentally change overnight.

## Won't Base-12 make Base-10 harder to learn?

The Alaskan Iñupiat have a Base-20 number system and use a featural positional numeral system, however, 
they also learn Base-10. It has been attested that this dual thinking in base-10 and base-20 might be 
comparable to advantages that bilingual students have in forming two ways of thinking about the world.

## Who can update this document?

Everyone is allowed to update this document if they see errors or they want to
improve the wording of a particular section.

New sections shouldn’t be added to this document unless:

- They have general community support,
- They are so minor they won’t impact upon anyone else’s work.

## What to do with contradictions?

This is an open source project which means errors and contradictions will appear.
If you notice two sections that contradict one another then please post them to
Reddit for discussion.
