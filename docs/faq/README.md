# FAQ

## Who is this language for?

This language can be utilised by anyone. However, Evildea stated a specific target audience for the language in his original proposal.

The end goal of this project is to create a language parents can raise their children speaking natively alongside their other native languages. The children would acquire this language like any other native language. Then, when the child starts their education, the parent would instruct them in how to analyse and parse their own native language to gain access to a wide range of mathematical and scientific knowledge. This will help the child to gain an intuitive understanding of the world around them and lower the amount of rote memorisation required.

## What knowledge will be encapsulated?

**We’re currently accepting proposals.**

The primary decider will be pertinence of usage (pertinence based for school-age or living day-by-day). We aim to include knowledge that speakers can use on a day to day basis.

The fields of knowledge that will be encapsulated are

**Formal Sciences:**

- Maths
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Geology
  
**Composite Sciences:**

- Technology (Engineering)
- Medicine
- Agronomy
- Geography

**Additional Fields:**

- Music
  
**Possible Additional Fields:**

There has been a suggestion to include knowledge from these scientific fields. We aren’t against this but haven’t seen any proposals.

- Psychology
- Sociology
- Economy
- Art.

## How will knowledge be encapsulated?

**We’re currently accepting proposals.**

## What is the process to change the language or add new knowledge?

In order to make changes to the language, the following process needs to be adhered to.

1. The **Proponent** of the change or addition needs to clearly define what aspect of the language they think needs to be changed or added to.
2. The **Proponent** then needs to check the “Encapsulated Language Project Documentation” to see whether any of the existing Draft Proposal covers their proposed changes or additions.
   - If there’s an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should throw their support behind that proposal.
   - If there isn’t an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should post their [Draft Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/) for feedback.
3. The **Proponent** should acknowledge community feedback and update their Draft Proposal accordingly.
4. If a **Draft Proposal** generates enough community feedback / support, Evildea will post a poll asking the community to either accept or reject the proposal. Members of the community will have 3 days to vote in the poll. If the Draft Proposal gets 50% or more support, the Draft Proposal will become an **Official Proposal**.

## When will the Language be finalised

A language can never be truly finalised, however, we do need an end date to work towards. Therefore, in exactly 5 years from 18th June 2020 (the founding date) all **Official Proposals** will become **Language Fundamentals** and all remaining **Draft Proposals** will be automatically rejected. The entire language will be published free online as a single book. For all intents and purposes, the language will be finalised and no single person or group will have the right to fundamentally change the language. Further developments in the language, however, can and will occur through natural language evolution.

## Why do we need to finalise the Language?

History has shown us time and again that language projects fail when they become unstable due to constant reforms and improvements. Therefore, a finalisation date for the core of the language is necessary to ensure its future survival and mass adoption.
Unfortunately this means the language will never be “perfect”, but it does mean that we’ll feel safe knowing that it won’t suddenly and fundamentally change overnight.

## Who can update this document?

Everyone is allowed to update this document if they see errors or they want to improve the wording of a particular section.

New sections shouldn’t be added to this document unless:

- They have general community support,
- They are so minor they won’t impact upon anyone else’s work.
  
## What to do with contradictions?

This is an open source project which means errors and contradictions will appear. If you notice two sections that contradict one another then please post them to Reddit for discussion.
