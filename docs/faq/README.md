## What kind of language is the Encapsulated Language Project creating?

The Encapsulated Language Project is creating a language that will store as much scientific and mathematical knowledge as possible. Naturally, this will result in an a priori language whose phonology, grammar and vocabulary will be consciously devised.

## What knowledge will be encapsulated?

::: tip We’re currently accepting proposals.
present your proposal in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/new/)
:::

The primary disciplines whose fundamentals will be encapsulated within the language are:

**Formal Sciences**
- Math

**Natural Sciences**
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Geology

**Composite Sciences**
- Technology (Engineering)
- Medicine
- Agronomy
- Geography

**Social Sciences**
- Psychology
- Sociology

A large array of knowledge from other disciplines will also be encapsulated. The primary decider on what knowledge is encapsulated and isn't will be pertinence of usage for school-age children. The aim is to store the fundamental concepts of each of these disciplines, not the entire discipline itself. 

## How is mathematical and scientific information encapsulated?

An example of encapsulation can be found in the [Official Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hvmhsr/official_proposal_vote_to_officialise_the_numeral/) for the numerals. The numerals have the following information cached within them:
- 3x multiplication table (Any numeral that consists of three strokes belongs to the 3x multiplication table)
- 4x multiplication table (Any numeral that contains only horizontal bars belongs to the 4x multiplication table)
- All numerals representing a number greater than 4 are built from the numerals 1, 2, 3, or 4.

A child who speaks this language natively would be taught how to recognise all the patterns that exist within their language. In the case of the numerals, they would be taught how to recognise the 3x and 4x multiplication tables visually. They'd also intuitively learn that numbers like 6 are actually additions consisting of 4 + 2.

## How do we intend on protecting the language against language degradation?

Esperanto is a perfect example of a language whose internal culture protects it against language degradation and haphazard evolution. The internal culture of Esperanto prizes evolution which improves upon the language, but doesn't divert from the rules laid out over a hundred years ago in the "Fundamento de Esperanto". In essence, it's the first language with a constitution that's actively upheld by all members of the community. 

Icelandic is another perfect example of a language whose prescriptivist culture protects it against unacceptable language evolution. In the early half of the 20th century, Icelandic started to undergo a rapid [/ɪ/-/ɛ/ merger](https://is.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flámæli). People in the West and South of Iceland started dropping their short i's and y's in favor of e's and œ's instead. Within a generation, this "speech error" rapidly spread across the island, and by 1929, 42% of children in Reykjavík spoke improper Icelandic. In the late 1940s, the Icelandic government implemented a campaign to systematically eradicate the speech error through early primary school education. The National Theater also enforced a policy of proper speech at all times. By the 1960s, this widespread speech error had been eliminated.

We intend on implementing our own constitution and foster a prescriptivist culture that actively protects our language from language degradation to protect the knowledge cached within it.

## What is the process to change the language or expand on the language?

In order to make changes to the language, the following process needs to be adhered to.

1. The **Proponent** of the change or addition needs to clearly define what aspect of the language they think needs to be changed or added to.
2. The **Proponent** then needs to check the “Encapsulated Language Project Documentation” to see whether any existing Draft Proposal covers their proposed changes or additions.
   - If there’s an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should throw their support behind that proposal.
   - If there isn’t an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should post their [Draft Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/) for feedback.
3. The **Proponent** should acknowledge community feedback and update their Draft Proposal accordingly.
4. If a **Draft Proposal** generates enough community feedback / support, the Proponent can send their finalized Proposal to the **Official Proposal Committee**. The Official Proposal Committee will review the Proposal and either accept or reject the Proposal based on their mandate. If the Proposal is accepted /u/ActingAustralia (Richard Delamore) will organise a community vote asking the community to either accept or reject the proposal. Members of the community will have 2 or 3 days to vote in the poll (depending on the severity of the change). If the Official Proposal gets 50% or more support, the Proposal will be promoted to an Official Proposal.

## What is the Official Proposal Committee?

The Official Proposal Committee is responsible for ensuring that all Draft Proposals seeking officialisation through community vote adhere to the aims and goals of the Language.

**Submission of Proposals**
The Proponent must send their finalized Draft Proposal to any member of the Official Proposal Committee with a request for Officialisation.

**Review of Proposals**
- The Official Proposal Committee must ensure that all Draft Proposals seeking officialisation through community vote adhere to the aims and goals of the Language.
- The Official Proposal Committee must provide a proponent of a rejected Draft Proposal with a reason for why the Proposal was rejected.
- If a vote to accept/reject a Proposal results in a tie, /u/ActingAustralia (Richard Delamore) will act as the tie breaker.

**Membership**
- The Official Proposal Committee consists of exactly six members.
- If a member retires from the committee or becomes inactive, the other members of the committee can vote to remove him/her. A vote for removal requires majority support among committee members.
- The committee can choose to fill a vacant position by any means it desires, however, the new committee member must have a strong record of consistent and active participation in the project to be eligible.

**Current Committee Members**

## When will the Language be finalised

A language can never be truly finalised, however, we do need an end date to work towards. Therefore, in exactly 5 years from 18th June 2020 (the founding date) all **Official Proposals** will become **Language Fundamentals** and all remaining **Draft Proposals** will be automatically rejected. The entire language will be published free online as a single book. For all intents and purposes, the language will be finalised and no single person or group will have the right to fundamentally change the language. Further developments in the language, however, can and will occur through natural language evolution.

## Why do we need to finalise the Language?

History has shown us time and again that language projects fail when they become unstable due to constant reforms and improvements. Therefore, a finalisation date for the core of the language is necessary to ensure its future survival and mass adoption.
Unfortunately this means the language will never be “perfect”, but it does mean that we’ll feel safe knowing that it won’t suddenly and fundamentally change overnight.

## Why Base-12?

Base-12 was promoted to an Official Proposal on the 30th of June 2020 (Base-12 vs Base-16) and again on the 3rd of July 2020 (Base-12 vs Base-6). Some of the reasons why Base-12 was preferred by the community at large are listed below. For a comprehensive list of reasons for and against Base-12, you'll need to dig through the subreddit history.

- Base-12 can be cleanly divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 making it more fraction-friendly than Base-10.
- Base-12 is already used to describe time.
- Base-12 requires less rote memorization than Base-10.
- Base-12 was considered a happy medium between the number of digits required and the resulting number of numerals.

Additionally, mathematical constants such as π can be represented in base-12 (or any base for that matter) as they simply represent ratios.

- π (base-10): 3.141592653...
- π (base-12): 3.184809493...

Finally, all computers operate on base-2 and constantly perform countless conversions between base-10 and base-2 every clock cycle. This means there would be no additional burden placed upon technology. 

## What is the history of the phonology?

The first proto-phonology was promoted to an Official Proposal on the 15th of July 2020. This was preceded by weeks of intense debates and official votes. This proposal eventually won community support because it was highly minimalistic and contained a pattern of 12 plosives and fricatives.

The phonology then underwent rapid development as the community improved upon it.

On the 18th of July 2020, the phonemes /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ were replaced with /f/ and /v/ to improve the plosive and fricative pattern. The phoneme /j/ was also introduced to extend the phonology further and due to its prevalence in world languages.

On the 22nd of July 2020, the /r/ was replaced with /ɾ/ because the trill was considered notoriously difficult and provided no advantage over the alveolar tap. 

The phonology is still considered highly unstable and further changes are expected.
