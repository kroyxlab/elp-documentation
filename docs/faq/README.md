## Who is this language for?

Although this language can be learned and utilized by anyone, Richard Delamore (Evildea), stated a specific target audience for the language in his original proposal.

The end goal of this project is to create a language parents can raise their children speaking natively alongside their other native languages. The children would acquire this language like any other native language. Then, when the child starts their education, the parent would instruct them on how to analyze and parse their native language to gain access to a wide range of mathematical and scientific knowledge. This will help the child to gain an intuitive understanding of the world around them and lower the amount of rote memorization required.

## What knowledge will be encapsulated?

::: tip We’re currently accepting proposals.
present your proposal in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/new/)
:::

The primary disciplines whose fundamentals will be encapsulated within the language are:

**Formal Sciences**
- Math

**Natural Sciences**
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Geology

**Composite Sciences**
- Technology (Engineering)
- Medicine
- Agronomy
- Geography

**Social Sciences**
- Psychology
- Sociology

A large array of knowledge from other disciplines will also be encapsulated. The primary decider on what knowledge is encapsulated and isn't will be pertinence of usage for school-age children. The aim is to store the fundamental concepts of each of these disciplines, not the entire discipline itself. 

## What is caching and parsing?
An example of caching can be found in the [Draft Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hfvung/when_encapsulation_is_going_too_far_part_ii/) for the numerals currently being developed for the language. The numerals have the following information cached within them:
- 3x multiplication table (Any numeral that consists of three strokes belongs to the 3x multiplication table)
- 4x multiplication table (Any numeral that contains only horizontal bars belongs to the 4x multiplication table)
- All numerals representing a number greater than 4 are built from the numerals 1, 2, 3, or 4.

A child who speaks this language natively would be taught how to recognise all the patterns that exist within their language. In the case of the numerals, they would be taught how to recognise the 3x and 4x multiplication tables visually. They'd also intuitively learn that numbers like 6 are actually additions consisting of 4 + 2.

## How do you we intend on protecting against knowledge degradation?
Esperanto is a perfect example of a language whose internal culture protects it against language degradation and haphazard evolution. The internal culture of Esperanto prizes evolution which improves upon the language, but doesn't divert from the rules laid out over a hundred years ago in the "Fundamento de Esperanto". In essence, its the first language with a constitution that's actively upheld by all members of the community. We intend to implement our own constitution to protect our language against such degradation.

## What is the process to change the language or add new knowledge?

In order to make changes to the language, the following process needs to be adhered to.

1. The **Proponent** of the change or addition needs to clearly define what aspect of the language they think needs to be changed or added to.
2. The **Proponent** then needs to check the “Encapsulated Language Project Documentation” to see whether any of the existing Draft Proposal covers their proposed changes or additions.
   - If there’s an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should throw their support behind that proposal.
   - If there isn’t an existing **Draft Proposal**, then the proponent should post their [Draft Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/) for feedback.
3. The **Proponent** should acknowledge community feedback and update their Draft Proposal accordingly.
4. If a **Draft Proposal** generates enough community feedback / support, the **Proponent** is to send their finalised Proposal to /u/ActingAustralia (Richard Delamore). Richard will organise a vote asking the community to either accept or reject the proposal. Members of the community will have 3 days to vote in the poll. If the Official Proposal gets 50% or more support, the Proposal will be promoted to an **Official Proposal**.

## When will the Language be finalised

A language can never be truly finalised, however, we do need an end date to work towards. Therefore, in exactly 5 years from 18th June 2020 (the founding date) all **Official Proposals** will become **Language Fundamentals** and all remaining **Draft Proposals** will be automatically rejected. The entire language will be published free online as a single book. For all intents and purposes, the language will be finalised and no single person or group will have the right to fundamentally change the language. Further developments in the language, however, can and will occur through natural language evolution.

## Why do we need to finalise the Language?

History has shown us time and again that language projects fail when they become unstable due to constant reforms and improvements. Therefore, a finalisation date for the core of the language is necessary to ensure its future survival and mass adoption.
Unfortunately this means the language will never be “perfect”, but it does mean that we’ll feel safe knowing that it won’t suddenly and fundamentally change overnight.

## Who can update this document?

Everyone is allowed to update this document if they see errors or they want to improve the wording of a particular section.

New sections shouldn’t be added to this document unless:

- They have general community support,
- They are so minor they won’t impact upon anyone else’s work.
  
## What to do with contradictions?

This is an open source project which means errors and contradictions will appear. If you notice two sections that contradict one another then please post them to Reddit for discussion.
