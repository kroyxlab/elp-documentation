# Shapes

The Encapsulated Language constructs 2D shapes in the following way:

| Core Word   |    Length    | Angle   |
| :---------: | :----------: | :-----: |
| geb         | dis          | ang     |

## Core Word

The core word, “geb” is mandatory to form a 2D shape. The /g/ and /b/ in geb have no inherent meaning, but /e/ refers to two-dimensional.

## Length

The word, "dis" isn't mandatory and refers to the length. This word refers to the symmetries that are lost because of the differences in length of segments.

In cases where a length and angle form are both mathematically equal, then the length form will primarily be used in spoken conversation. For example, an Isosceles Triangle could be written as either zjan geb fun dis or zjan geb zjan ang but the speaker should revert to the length form.

## Angle

The word, "ang" isn't mandatory and refers to the angle. This word refers to the symmetries that are lost because of the differences in angle of the corners.

## Examples

## Notes

This system when moved to higher dimensions will take a shape from a lower dimension in place of the line for the 2D (geb) case. The 3D (gab) case will use planes. And the 4d (gib) case will use cubes.
