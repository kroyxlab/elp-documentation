## Consonants and Diphthongs

The Encapsulated Language uses the following romanization for consonants and
diphthongs:

| IPA          | m | p | b | f | v | n | t | d | s | z |
| ------------ | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Romanization | m | p | b | f | v | n | t | d | s | z |

| IPA          | ɲ  | c  | ɟ  | ɕ  | ʑ  | ŋ  | k | g | x  | ɣ  |
| ------------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | - | - | -- | -- |
| Romanization | nj | tj | dj | sj | zj | ng | k | g | kh | gh |

- /ʔ/ is written as an apostrophe when it's immediately before an approximate or between two vowels that would otherwise make a diphthong.
- The epenthetic consonant “l” is unwritten and doesn’t have a romanization.

The Encapsulated Language uses the following romanization for vowels and diphthongs:

| ------------ | - | --- | - | --- | - | --- | - | --- | - | --- | - | --- |
