# Romanization

The Encapsulated Language uses the following systems of romanization.

## Consonants and Diphthongs

The Encapsulated Language uses the following romanization for consonants and
diphthongs:

| IPA          | m | p | b | f | v | n | t | d | s | z |
| ------------ | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Romanization | m | p | b | f | v | n | t | d | s | z |

| IPA          | ɲ  | c  | ɟ  | ɕ  | ʑ  | ŋ  | k | g | x  | ɣ  |
| ------------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | - | - | -- | -- |
| Romanization | nj | tj | dj | sj | zj | ng | k | g | kh | gh |

| IPA          | ai̯ | ei̯ | oi̯ | au̯ | eu̯ | ou̯ |
| ------------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Romanization | ai | ei | oi | au | eu | ou |

- /ʔ/ is written as an apostrophe when it's immediately before an approximate or between two vowels that would otherwise make a diphthong.
- The epenthetic consonant “l” is unwritten and doesn’t have a romanization.

The Encapsulated Language uses the following two systems of romanization for
the vowels:

## Vowels (Primary System)

This system must be used by all Official Proposals and training materials.

| IPA          | i | iː | y | yː | u | uː | e | eː | o | oː | a | aː |
| ------------ | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- |
| Romanization | i | ī  | y | ȳ  | u | ū  | e | ē  | o | ō  | a | ā  |

## Vowels (Alternative System)

This system can be used in informal settings when the primary means proves
too difficult to type.

| IPA          | i | iː | y | yː | u | uː | e | eː | o | oː | a | aː |
| ------------ | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- |
| Romanization | i | ih | y | yh | u | uh | e | eh | o | oh | a | ah |
