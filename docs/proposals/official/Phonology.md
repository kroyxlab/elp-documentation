## Phonotactics

The Encapsulated Language obeys the following phonotactic constraints:

**Syllable Construction:**

A syllable is built from an onset, an initial nucleus, a final nucleus, and a coda in that order.

**Onset Phoneme group:**

The onset phoneme group contains /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, /ʔ/, /m/, /n/, /ɾ/, /f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /ɕ/, /ʑ/, /x/, /ɣ/, /j/, /l/, /c/, /ɟ/, /ɲ/, /ŋ/ and /w/

**Initial and Final Nucleus Phoneme group:**

The nucleus phoneme group contains /i/, /iː/, /y/, /yː/, /u/, /uː/, /e/, /eː/, /o/, /oː/, /a/ and /aː/

**Coda Phoneme group:**

The coda phoneme group contains a null phoneme, /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, /n/, /ɾ/, /f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /ɕ/, /ʑ/, /x/, /ɣ/, /c/ and /ɟ/

**Vowel pair realization:**

- Two identical adjacent vowels become a single instance of that vowel.
- /l/ is an epenthetic consonant between two vowels that do not form a legal diphthong.
- /il/ becomes /ij/.
- /ul/ becomes /uw/.
