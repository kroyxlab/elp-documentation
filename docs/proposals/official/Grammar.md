## Probability

Words in a sentence can be optionally marked with a probability to demonstrate how likely they are. This probability marking can be derived partly from the word for that percentage - something with an exactly 50% chance would be derived from the word for 50%. There are also less specific words that mean things like "probably", that can mark words in similar ways.

In a sentence like, "I killed your father," any or all of the words can be marked. Marking the word "I" with a probability produces something like "I(75%) killed your father". This indicates that the likelihood that I killed him, as opposed to somebody else, is higher. Similarly, marking the sentence like "I killed(75%) your father" indicates that the likelihood that I killed him rather than, say, went out for a drink with him. "I killed your(75%) father" marks the probability that it was your father rather than someone else's.

To mark the entire sentence with a probability, the marking should be placed on an auxiliary verb at a not-yet-determined point in the sentence. The sentence would be changed to something like "S(75%) I killed your father", marking the probability that I did or didn't kill your father.
