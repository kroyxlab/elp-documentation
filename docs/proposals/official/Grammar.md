# Grammar

## Sublanguage

The sublanguage is a subset of the spoken or written language used to encapsulate arbitrary information.

- Sublanguage words are less specific or as specific as their Encapsulated Language counterparts.
- Sublanguage grammar is the same as its Encapsulated Language counterpart, unless otherwise specified.

In summary, any rule that exists in the sublanguage must also exist in the main language, but not every rule that exists in the main language must also exist in the sublanguage.

## Structure

Nouns and verbs are composed of a grammatical part and a semantic part.

The grammatical part is the head of the verb/noun phrase as it determines the phrase's part-of speech.

- Thematic role such as agent, patient, etc. for nouns.

- Person of argument(s) of the verb for verbs.

The semantic part is the dependant of the verb/noun phrase. It carries the bulk of the information.

## Tense, Aspect and Mood

Roots are heads of root phrases in which TAM (tense, aspect and mood) markers are optional dependants.

## Quantifiers
There are a few basic pronouns which act as quantifiers.

There are two main quantifier: "to" for "all" (everything), which is called the universal quantifier, and one for "some" (something(s)), which is called the existential quantifier. As placeholders, the word "sa" will be used for the universal quantifier and "ma" will be used for the existential quantifier.

The universal quantifier is used to indicate everything in a certain set/context. The context can be specified using the placeholder word "pa" which means "in the set of". So, "all people are tired" usually doesn't mean that everyone in the entire world is tired, it just means that everyone is the group of people we're talking about is tired.

The existential quantifier is the opposite of the universal quantifier. It's used to talk about part of a set. As with the universal quantifier, we can use "pa" to specify the set we're talking about.

To use them with nouns, we must use apposition. So, "all people" is treated as an apposition of the universal quantifier (a pronoun) and "people" (a noun). "people" is the word we use to restrict the range of "everything". It basically mean "everything fitting the property of person".

To indicate existence, we say that a certain amount of things are something else. So, to say "there are cats", we would say "some(thing) is cats". To add a specific quantity, we can replace "some" with another word, like "5 are cats" which means "there are 5 cats", and "many are cats" which means "there are many cats".

To indicate the lack of something, we use negation: "There are no cats" would be "all (everything) is not cats". "I saw no cats" would be "I didn't see all cats". Thus, in general, there is no word meaning "no", although there may be a specific word to indicate a lack of something in places where it's necessary, like on a scale or other measuring devices. "no" is formed using "all" + negative.

Negation is always put on the word being negated. So, we wouldn't say "I went with no one", or "I didn't go with anyone", but rather "I went not with anyone", since the negation is about the word "with".

"not" is always tightly bound.

## Probability

Words in a sentence can be optionally marked with a probability to demonstrate how likely they are. This probability marking can be derived partly from the word for that percentage - something with an exactly 50% chance would be derived from the word for 50%. There are also less specific words that mean things like "probably", that can mark words in similar ways.

In a sentence like, "I killed your father," any or all of the words can be marked. Marking the word "I" with a probability produces something like "I(75%) killed your father". This indicates that the likelihood that I killed him, as opposed to somebody else, is higher. Similarly, marking the sentence like "I killed(75%) your father" indicates that the likelihood that I killed him rather than, say, went out for a drink with him. "I killed your(75%) father" marks the probability that it was your father rather than someone else's.

To mark the entire sentence with a probability, the marking should be placed on an auxiliary verb at a not-yet-determined point in the sentence. The sentence would be changed to something like "S(75%) I killed your father", marking the probability that I did or didn't kill your father.
