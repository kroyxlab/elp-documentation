# Grammar

## Sublanguage

The sublanguage is a subset of the spoken or written language used to encapsulate arbitrary information.

- Sublanguage words are less specific or as specific as their Encapsulated Language counterparts.
- Sublanguage grammar is the same as its Encapsulated Language counterpart, unless otherwise specified.

In summary, any rule that exists in the sublanguage must also exist in the main language, but not every rule that exists in the main language must also exist in the sublanguage.

## Structure

Nouns and verbs are composed of a grammatical part and a semantic part.

The grammatical part is the head of the verb/noun phrase as it determines the phrase's part-of speech.

- Thematic role such as agent, patient, etc. for nouns.

- Person of argument(s) of the verb for verbs.

The semantic part is the dependant of the verb/noun phrase. It carries the bulk of the information.

## Probability

Words in a sentence can be optionally marked with a probability to demonstrate how likely they are. This probability marking can be derived partly from the word for that percentage - something with an exactly 50% chance would be derived from the word for 50%. There are also less specific words that mean things like "probably", that can mark words in similar ways.

In a sentence like, "I killed your father," any or all of the words can be marked. Marking the word "I" with a probability produces something like "I(75%) killed your father". This indicates that the likelihood that I killed him, as opposed to somebody else, is higher. Similarly, marking the sentence like "I killed(75%) your father" indicates that the likelihood that I killed him rather than, say, went out for a drink with him. "I killed your(75%) father" marks the probability that it was your father rather than someone else's.

To mark the entire sentence with a probability, the marking should be placed on an auxiliary verb at a not-yet-determined point in the sentence. The sentence would be changed to something like "S(75%) I killed your father", marking the probability that I did or didn't kill your father.
