# Official Proposals

Following is a list of Official Proposals. A Official Proposal defines an aspect of the language that has community support (it has been voted on and approved by 50% of voting participants). All Draft Proposals must work in accordance with these Official Proposals unless they call to replace an Official Proposal. 

## Community Administration
Richard Delamore (Evildea) is the gatekeeper for all votes on Official Proposals. Proponents of Official Proposals must first contact him before posting a vote on an Official Proposal. He is responsible for ensuring a vote on an Official Proposal doesn't contradict an existing Official Proposal, unless it's seeking to replace an existing Official Proposal. He is also responsible for ensuring there is enough information, that it's formatted correctly and clearly.
