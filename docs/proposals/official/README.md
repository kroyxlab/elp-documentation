# Official Proposals

Following is a list of Official Proposals. A Official Proposal defines an aspect of the language that has community support (it has been voted on and approved by 50% of voting participants). All Draft Proposals must work in accordance with these Official Proposals unless they call to replace an Official Proposal. 

## Community Administration
The Official Proposal Committee is responsible for ensuring that all Draft Proposals are in accordance with the aims and goals of the Language.
