# Official Proposals

Following is a list of Official Proposals. A Official Proposal defines an aspect
of the language that has community support (it has been voted on and approved by
50% of voting participants). All Draft Proposals must work in accordance with
these Official Proposals unless they call to replace an Official Proposal.

## Aims and Goals

The Aims and Goals of the Language can be read [here](https://kroyxlab.github.io/elp-documentation/documentation.html).

## Romanization

The Encapsulated Language uses the following romanization for consonants and diphthongs:

| IPA          | ʃ  | ʒ  | t͡s | d͡z | t͡ʃ  | d͡ʒ  | ɾ | x  | ɣ  |
| ------------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | --- | --- | - | -- | -- |
| Romanization | sh | zh | ts | dz | tsh | dzh | r | kh | gh |

| IPA          | ai̯ | ei̯ | oi̯ | au̯ | eu̯ | ou̯ |
| ------------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Romanization | ai | ei | oi | au | eu | ou |

The Encapsulated Language uses the following two systems of romanization for the vowels:

### The primary system:

This system must be used by all Official Proposals and training materials.

| IPA          | i | iː | y | yː | u | uː | e | eː | o | oː | a | aː |
| ------------ | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- |
| Romanization | i | ī  | y | ȳ  | u | ū  | e | ē  | o | ō  | a | ā  |

### The alternative system:

This system must can be used in informal settings when the primary means proves too difficult to type.

| IPA          | i | iː | y | yː | u | uː | e | eː | o | oː | a | aː |
| ------------ | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- | - | -- |

## Phonological Values

The following phonemes have inherent numerical values in the Encapsulated Language:

| Numbers |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 - 3   | v   | f   | gh  | kh  |

## Numerals

The Encapsulated Language uses the following numerals.

![Numerals](/elp-documentation/img/Numerals.png)

The numeral '0' can be represented by a little circle such as the symbol for a
degree (°), but centred in the middle of the line, like a dot (•) when writing
the numeral by **hand only**.

## Number Words

### Single-Digit Number Words

Single-digit numbers are built from both the consonant and vowel that
represents their phonological value plus the consonant /n/.

| Numbers | Number Word |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 0       | vin         |
| 1       | fun         |
| 2       | ghyn        |
| 3       | khan        |
| 4       | zen         |
| 5       | son         |
| 6       | zhīn        |
| 7       | shūn        |
| 8       | dzȳn        |
| 9       | tsān        |
| X (10)  | dzhēn       |
| E (11)  | tshōn       |

The single-digit number system can also be used to express a string of digits
such as a phone number
For example, **(605).475.6968** can be expressed as **zhīn vin son - zen shūn
son - zhīn tsān zhīn dzȳn**

### Trinumeral Number Words (10 - EEE)

The number words (10 - EEE) are called trinumeral number words. They are built
by adding specific constants and vowels together to form whole numbers. The
consonants and vowels each have a numerical value assigned to them which, when
combined, give whole digit numbers.

Trinumerals are built using the following rules:

- Phonemes in numbers are organized in a CVC fashion.
- The first number in the gross\* place will receive a consonant.
- The second number in the dozens\* place will receive a vowel.
- The last number in the one's place will receive a consonant.

* Gross is 144 in base-10 which is the base-12 equivalent of the hundreds place. Dozen is 12 in base-10 which is the base-12 equivalent of the tens place.

Number 0-E (0 - 11 in base-10) are left out of this list because single-digit
numbers have a special dual purpose as being the first countable numbers in the
set as well as being the means of communication for speaking these numbers.

Examples:

| Numbers (base-12) | Trinumeral |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| 10                | vuv        |
| 11                | vuf        |
| 12                | vugh       |
| 13                | vukh       |
| 14                | vuz        |
| 15                | vus        |

### Numeric Prefixes

The Encapsulated Language uses the following numeric prefixes.

The numeric prefixes are used as an extension to the base number word system to
represent the magnitude of a value. They form number words similar to “million”
and “billion” in English, but allow a greater level of precision that
scientific notation is normally capable of expressing.

| Numeric Prefix | Value   |
| -------------- | ------- |
| ei-            | 1000^0  |
| wa-            | 1000^1  |
| jo-            | 1000^2  |
| eu-            | 1000^3  |
| ai-            | 1000^4  |
| wo-            | 1000^5  |
| je-            | 1000^6  |
| au-            | 1000^7  |
| oi-            | 1000^8  |
| we-            | 1000^9  |
| ja-            | 1000^10 |
| ou-            | 1000^11 |

Examples of numeric prefix use with single-digit number words:

| Numbers       | Numeric Prefix |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| 1             | **ei**fun      |
| 1,000         | **wa**fun      |
| 1,000,000     | **jo**fun      |
| 1,000,000,000 | **eu**fun      |

## Color

The Encapsulated Language constructs colors in the following way:

If **head initial** is Officialized, then color words are formed in the following way:

| Lightness                     | Core Color | Hue                           | Chroma                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Represented by a  number word | Wil        | Represented by a  number word | Represented by a  number word |

If **head final** is Officialized, then color words are formed in the following way:

| Chroma                        | Hue                            | Core Color | Lightness                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Represented by a  number word |  Represented by a  number word | Wil        |Represented by a  number word |

### Lightness

A number word represents the lightness of the final color. For example:

- A value of 0 is equal to pure black.
- A value of 6 is equal to grey.
- A value of E (11) is equal to pure white.

The addition of the lightness isn’t mandatory. If the lightness isn’t specified, then a value of 6 is assumed for the lightness. However, an unspecified brightness is more vague than a brightness of 6.

### Core Color

The core word, “wil” is mandatory to form a color.

### Hue

A number word represents the hue of the final color. This represents the hue in the CIELCh color space. For example:

- A value of 0 is equal to 0°. This represents a magentish color.
- A value of 6 is equal to 165°. This represents a greenish color.
- A value of E (11) is equal to 330°. This represents purplish color.

The addition of the hue isn’t mandatory. If the hue isn't specified, then a value of 0 is assumed for the chroma. This represents an achromatic color (greyscale color).

### Chroma

A number word represents the chroma of the final color. This represents the chroma in the CIELCh color space. For example:

- A value of 0 is equal to 16⅔. This represents a dull color.
- A value of E (11) is equal to 200. This represents a vibrant color.

The addition of the chroma isn’t mandatory. If the chroma is added then the hue must also be added. If the chroma isn’t specified, but the hue is, then a value of 5 is assumed for the chroma. However, an unspecified chroma is more vague than a chroma of 5.

### Relative Precision

The numbers used for the **lightness**, **hue**, and **chroma** can be scaled down to increase precision. This level of precision isn’t required by the majority of speakers and is reserved for technical use only.

| Color Word         | Meaning                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| wil **fun**        | one twelfth of a hue rotation |
| wil **vif**        | 0.001 of a hue rotation       |
| wil **wafun fun**  | 0.1001 of a hue rotation      |

### Summary

The below picture represents one lightness slice of the CIELCh color space. 

- The rotation of the small squares clockwise represents the hue. 
- The outward radiating of the small squares represents the chroma. 
- The areas of the color circle that aren’t visible represent those colors that can’t be displayed by a monitor but (mostly) are visible to the human eye.

### Examples

The Encapsulated Language color words are actually more precise than their English color word equivalents.
These examples use **head initial** ordering. If **head final** is Officialize then these examples will change.
