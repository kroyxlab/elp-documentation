## What is and isn't considered the Encapsulated Language

It's vitally important to the success of the Language that the mathematical and scientific knowledge encapsulated within it doesn't become lost with time. This doesn't mean that we must fight against all language evolution, it just means that we must carefully manage its evolution to avoid knowledge degradation.

To ensure this; any form of the Encapsulated Language is considered valid unless it's either not understandable by the Encapsulated Language speakers or it reduces the language's ability to encapsulate information. If either of these conditions are met, the speaker may certainly use whatever offshoot of the language they wish for personal use, but it will not be considered correct Encapsulated Language.

So is it even possible to manage the evolution of a language?

Yes, Esperanto is a perfect example of a language whose internal culture protects it against language mutation and haphazard evolution. The internal culture of Esperanto prizes evolution which improves upon the language, but doesn't divert from the rules laid out over a hundred years ago in the "Fundamento de Esperanto". In essence, it's the first language with a constitution that's actively upheld by the majority of the community.

Icelandic is another example of a language whose prescriptivist culture prevents unwanted language evolution. In the early half of the 20th century, Icelandic started to undergo a rapid [/ɪ/-/ɛ/ merger](https://is.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A1m%C3%A6li). People in the West and South of Iceland started dropping their short i's and y's in favor of e's and œ's instead. Within a generation, this "speech error" rapidly spread across the island, and by 1929, 42% of children in Reykjavík spoke improper Icelandic. In the late 1940s, the Icelandic government implemented a campaign to systematically eradicate this "speech error" through early primary school education. The National Theater also enforced a policy of proper speech at all times. By the 1960s, this widespread "speech error" had been eliminated.

We intend on implementing our own constitution and foster a selectively prescriptivist culture that actively protects certain parts of our language from language mutation in order to protect the knowledge cached within it without attempting to enforce arbitrary rules that don’t contribute to the goal of the language.
