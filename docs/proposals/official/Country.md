# Country Names

The names of the countries will be formed in the following way:

- The name of the country will be adapted from the main language spoken within the country, according to the Encapsulated Language phonology. The countries in which more than one language is spoken by majorities (such as Belgium, Switzerland, Papua New Guinea, etc.) will be regarded and thought out separately.
- A location adfix will be added to the country name which states which continent the country stands on.
- A toponym adfix will be added to the country name. This rule must be consistent and will be applied to all countries.
