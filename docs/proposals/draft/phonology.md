| [u/Anjeez929](https://www.reddit.com/u/Anjeez929)           |     v1.1      | This phonology encodes digits in a 12 base system. The author suggests it might work with Flamerate1's Draft Proposal | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hlzh9q/phonology_proposal/)     |
| [u/Devono_knabo](https://www.reddit.com/u/Devono_knabo)           |     v1.0      | This phonology doesn't include any information on what can be encapsulated. | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hlzh9q/phonology_proposal/)     |
| [u/koallary](https://www.reddit.com/u/koallary)           |     v1.0      | This phonology consists of a syllabary that encapsulates the 1-12x multiplication table with the option of extending to larger tables. It also has the ability to encapsulate odd and even numbers with the possibility of the periodic table. | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hlskxu/draft_proposal%CB%90_phonology_based_on_base_12/)     |
| [u/DemoseDT](https://www.reddit.com/u/DemoseDT)           |     v1.0      | This phonology builds on the work of u/ArmoredFarmer’s and u/Flamerate1's phonology. It encodes even and odd numbers directly into the sound of language through the use of rounded and unrounded vowels. The phonology is also designed to work with a hybridized hex, dozenal system. | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hihvjk/draft_proposal_hex_dozenal_hybrid_vowel_system/)     |
| [u/ArmoredFarmer](https://www.reddit.com/u/ArmoredFarmer) |     v1.0      | This phonology builds on the work of u/Flamerate1’s phonology. It encodes even and odd numbers directly into the sound of language through the use of back and front vowels. The stated purpose is to make the constants easier to pronounce.                                           | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hh6uiw/another_draft_proposal_for_phonology_armoredfarmer/) |
| [u/Flamerate1](https://www.reddit.com/u/Flamerate1)       |     v1.0      | This phonology encodes even and odd numbers directly into the sound of the language through the use of voiced and unvoiced consonants.                                                                                                                                                   | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/heo82f/phonology_draft_proposition_flamerate1_f1_for_help/) |
| [u/Anjeez929 ](https://www.reddit.com/u/Anjeez929 )       |     v1.0      | (NO LONGER VALID) This phonology encodes digits in a 16 base system as constants and vowels.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hdqgzv/a_base_sixteen_themed_thing/)                        |
