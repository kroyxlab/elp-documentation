| u/DemoseDT |     v1.0      | This phonology builds on the work of u/ArmoredFarmer’s and u/Flamerate1's phonology. It encodes even and odd numbers directly into the sound of language through the use of rounded and unrounded vowels. The phonology is also designed to work with a hybridized hex, dozenal system. | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hihvjk/draft_proposal_hex_dozenal_hybrid_vowel_system/) |
| u/ArmoredFarmer |     v1.0      | This phonology builds on the work of u/Flamerate1’s phonology. It encodes even and odd numbers directly into the sound of language through the use of back and front vowels. The stated purpose is to make the constants easier to pronounce. | [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/comments/hh6uiw/another_draft_proposal_for_phonology_armoredfarmer/) |
